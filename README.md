$Relaxation Methods Final:$ Applying iterative techniques on 2-d "spaces" to find approximate solutions to Laplace's eq. Potential function solutions plotted in contours and 3d plots. Several boundary conditions are given, including point charge, charged plates, faraday cage demo.

Harmonic Functions on a Disk: Extension of Relaxation Methods, but applied to a disk shape

Delta&H Plots, Vector Field Simulator, Field Lines, and Taylor Comparison:
- Plots of the Dirac Delta and Heavyside Function
- Vector Field Arrow diagrams given for a couple charge distributions
- Field Line diagrams " "
- Plots compare actual long distance dipole field behavior to taylor approximation, error is plotted as well
